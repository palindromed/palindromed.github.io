# Getting Started with Cryptography and security (WIP)

I got curious about cryptography in 2018. There are a few resources I've enjoyed so far.

* Dan Boneh's [Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto/)
* Montesanto CryptoPals [challenges](http://cryptopals.com/)
* LVH's [Crypto 101](https://www.crypto101.io/)
* The Code Book by [Simon Singh](https://simonsingh.net/books/the-code-book/)
