# Licanius Trilogy

Author: James Islington

Complete Trilogy

Type: Audio (Michael Kramer)

## The Shadow of What Was Lost (Book 1 - 2015)

Confession. I didn't enjoy this book the first time around. The series has a good amount of characters, world building and time travel. I had been looking for a mindless read and this didn't hit the mark. Tried again in 2020 and tore through it.

## An Echo of Things to Come(Book 2 - 2017)

Solid second book. By the time I read it, the third book was out. Don't know if my feeling about the series would be different if I'd had to wait.

## The Light of All that Falls (Book 3 - 2019)

I am cursed with being able to figure out the ending before the reveal. In this case, I was almost 100% right in how I thought the series would end early in the second book. Enjoyable read. On my second try, finished the trilogy in under a week.
