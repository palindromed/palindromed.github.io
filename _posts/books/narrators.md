# Narrators for Audio books

I found audio books in 2014 and was hooked. Reading has always been a favorite pastime for me but it requires a lot of sitting which isn't a strong suit.

Being able to "read" while running errands, cleaning or exercising works well for me. My listening is mostly fiction and my ebooks or dead tree books are usually nonfiction. Some people are able to listen to any book and remember details but that doesn't work as well for me. Because of this, most of the books I listen to are fiction, specifically fantasy or sci fi.

I go through books quickly. This is true of all formats but especially audio. One strategy I've used to find new audio books is to look for books based on narrator. That doesn't always work but has helped me find several series I've enjoyed. Note, a bad narrator can kill a good book and a good narrator can make a bad book enjoyable.

## Favorite Narrators

This is an incomplete list of narrators I find easy to listen to. In several cases, I don't enjoy them at regular speed. My default listening speed is between 1 - 1.5x, but I have gone up to 2.5x in a couple cases due to slow speech or excessive pauses.
